# PepsiMax-MaxMSPModel-of-Gordon-Mumma-Sound-Modifier-Console-Osaka-1970
A Max MSP model of Gordon Mumma's Sound modifying console purpose built for the Pepsi Pavilion at the 1970 Osaka World Fair.  
All the parameters and ranges are modelled after the the euro rack circuit kit designed by Michael Johnsen (original schematic by Gordon Mumma, updated by Johnsen for euro rack format).  
The oscillator and envelope ranges are quite limited, presumably due to the limitation of the hardware at the time. 
This MaxMSP recreation attempted to stay as true to the ranges found on Johnsen's euro rack module kit.
